## Key Concepts

link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/blob/main/users_guide/figures/glossary/Frame.blend[Frame.blend] | **As defined in link:https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:19111:ed-3:v1:en[ISO 19111], a reference Frame is a parameter or set of parameters that realize the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system.**

Another, more practical definition link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference[from Wikipedia] is: _"In physics, a (reference) frame consists of an abstract coordinate system and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements within that frame."_

A Reference Frame can be visualized as a subspace with its own link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system[coordinate system] (represented with an arrow for each axis and a 2D grid to facilitate measurements) and a point of origin (represented as a sphere at the point where the arrows intersect). Generally, to simplify calculations, the associated coordinate systems are Cartesian in nature, but in the case of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry[non-euclidean spaces], they require more advanced definitions (like the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system[geographical coordinate systems] used in global positioning systems).

| [[def_pose]] **Pose** +

| **"A Pose determines the position and orientation of an object (or group of objects) relative to a coordinate system.”**

In Robotics and Human-Computer Interaction, this concept is often referred to as link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_freedom[Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF)] and it is used to specify the position and orientation of an object with great precision (generally, by combining a *Local Positioning System* for the translation and an *Aircraft Principal Axes Orientation System* for the rotation). In this way, it is possible to define complex link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics[kinematic systems] that allow the creation of advanced link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_arm[robotic arms] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_exoskeleton[exoskeletons].

From the point of view of computer graphics, however, a Pose can be seen as a simplified version of a "Transform class" (without the *Scale*-related fields/properties). This direct correspondence implies that a Pose is associated to a single node of an Scene Graph (i.e., the "hand" has a Pose, the "arm" has another Pose, etc.), but, when 3D artists and engineers talk about "Poses", they are generally referring to the combined Pose data of all the components of an entity (i.e., the Pose of a dummy, as seen in the illustration). In fact, most 3D editing software solutions include a separate "Pose mode" so that artists can independently work on the geometry of the different 3D models and on their animation.


| [[def_pose_chain]] **Pose Chain** +

*TODO: Change from "Scene Graph" to "Pose Chain"*

**“A Pose Chain represents a.”** 

Scene Graphs are often represented with connectors between the origin points of the Transforms of each object in the scene. And ore often than not, Scene Graphs have a tree structure that facilitates the identification of the different parts of the scene. However, this hierarchical organization can introduce problems when an object has to change parents (e.g., when the person in the illustration grabs the teapot from the table), because the 3D engine has to remove all the Transform operations of the old branch and apply all of the others for the new branch.


| [[def_geopose]] **GeoPose** +

link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/blob/main/users_guide/figures/glossary/GeoPose.blend[GeoPose.blend] 
| **"A GeoPose is a fixed *Pose* related to an astronomical object (by default, Earth) via a Topocentric <<Frame,Reference Frame>>."**

A GeoPose facilitates the generation of a *Transform* (and the associated transformation matrix) to properly place and orient modes in a *Scene Graph* (generally, the root one) on a realistic 3D map and/or in an Augmented/Mixed Reality environment.

| [[def_bc_location]] **Location**
| **"Not to be confused with the term Position, a location is a distinctive region of a space."**

While a Position merely specifies a single point within a space (relative to a <<def_frame, Frame>>), a Location defines a limited region within a space (often with its very own <<def_frame, Frame>>). A location generally receives a unique name within a context (or within another location) to easily identify it among others and, if necessary, it can also have a additional semantic information to further differentiate it (e.g., "Washington D.C.", "Washington State" and "Washington City, Utah"). There are as many types of locations as there are types of spaces (e.g., "the bottom of screen", "behind the car", "Earth's orbit", etc.), but it is specially relevant in the context of Geography, where the *Geo*location ("In which street/road/town I am?") is often much more important than the actual *Geo*position ("what are my GPS coordinates?").

The boundaries of Locations are often defined using either dimensional properties (i.e., width, height and depth) or specific shapes (most notably, 2D projections in a geographical space called link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence[Geofences]). However, when there are a large amount of locations or these are constantly changing, the boundaries are defined by proximity to the closest point in the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_skeleton[topological skeleton] or by the minimum number of logical connections.
