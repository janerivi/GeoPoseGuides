# Best Practice template

This GitHub repository contains the content for an OGC Best Practice.

The repo is organized as follows:

* index.adoc - nothing in this document
* best_practice - the main Best Practice document content
  - organized in multiple sections and directories
  - this is the only part needed to create a Best Practice document
  - the document structure is modeled after that of an OGC standard, however, you may change or remove sections as you need to best construct a Best Practice document
