When working with physical spaces or virtual 3D scenes, the point of origin is generally situated in the center of the space (to avoid the limitations of [single-precision floating-point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format)). However, when operating within 2D spaces with clear boundaries, like screens or documents, the point of origin is normally placed in the top-left corner (due to the graphic systems based on the left-to-right, top-to-bottom writing direction used in most western countries). Needless to say, this makes the transformations between the different frames (i.e., determining what 3D object has the user selected on a 2D screen) a very cumbersome process.<br><br>In recent years, advancements in [Indoor Positioning Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_positioning_system) technologies have enabled the precise tracking of real-world elements in relatively large *local* subspaces. Yet, when a use case has more than a single location or the curvature of the Earth becomes an important factor to take into account, using a Global Location System is generally a better option. |
| **Global Systems** | ![GlobalPositioning](https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/blob/main/users_guide/figures/glossary/GlobalPositioning.png) <br> [GlobalPositioning.blend](https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/blob/main/users_guide/figures/glossary/GlobalPositioning.blend) | ***"A Global Positioning System defines the location of objects relative to a *Frame* based on [spherical spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry), generally associated with the planet Earth."***<br><br> As its name implies, a Global Positioning System is defined by a spherical object that establishes the properties of a *Frame* itself (even if the astronomical body is not a perfect sphere). The resulting subspace is delimited in the two horizontal dimensions of the surface of a sphere (*longitude* should only have values between -180 and 180 degrees, whereas the *latitude* values should be within a -90 to 90 degrees) and partially delimited in the vertical dimension (*altitude* values should never be lower than the negative value of the radius of the sphere). As for the point of origin of this subspace, for practical reasons, it is generally placed on an arbitrary point alongside the equator of the sphere (thus, also defining an offset value for the altitude values).<br><br> Traditionally, determining the position of an object on the surface of the Earth with any degree of accuracy required cumbersome tools and manual calculations. Fortunately, nowadays, the existence of satellite-based radio-navigation systems like [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System), [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation)) or [NavIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Regional_Navigation_Satellite_System) has greatly simplified the process and -as long as the devices can establish visual contact with three satellites- it is possible to track the position of all kinds of objects on Earth.  |
| **Universal Systems** | ![UniversalPositioning](https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/blob/main/users_guide/figures/glossary/UniversalPositioning.png) <br> [UniversalPositioning.blend](https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/blob/main/users_guide/figures/glossary/UniversalPositioning.blend) | ***"A Universal Positioning System defines the location of objects relative to an Inertial Frame based on [Minkowski spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space)."***<br><br>These systems aim to provide a more precise and truly unique positioning for objects relative to an inertial point in the physical Universe (generally, the barycenter of the Solar System). However, since the Minkowski spaces are defined by the rules of [Special Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativy), the very subspaces are "curved" by [Lorentz Transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation) and any traversal is limited by the [Speed of Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light).<br><br>Needless to say, the extremely complex calculations that these positioning systems require relegating them to applications related with interplanetary travel and communications. For example, the SPICE framework created by the NASA's Planetary Science Division operates with both the [J2000 and ICRF Inertial Frames](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/Tutorials/pdf/individual_docs/17_frames_and_coordinate_systems.pdf) to calculate transfer orbits between bodies of the Solar System. |
