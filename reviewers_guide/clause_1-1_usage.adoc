## How To Use This Resource

The GeoPose Reviewers Guide is not intended to be read from start to finish. Rather, it is a resource structured to provide quick answers to questions which a reviewer may have about the GeoPose Standard. It is provided to support professionals who need to understand GeoPose and/or are reviewing the GeoPose draft standard but do not wish to implement it.

In addition, this guide can provide insights to professionals considering adopting GeoPose for their projects and products.

The GeoPose Reviewers Guide contains hyperlinks which can be used to navigate directly to relevant sections of the guide as well as to sections of the https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPose/blob/main/standard/pdf/geopose_standard.pdf[draft GeoPose specification] and the https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/blob/working-draft/GeoPose-Users-Guide.pdf[GeoPose User Guide].
