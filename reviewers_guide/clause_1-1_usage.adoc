== How To Use This Resource

The GeoPose Reviewers Guide is not intended to be read from start to finish. Rather, it is a resource structured to provide quick answers to questions which a reviewer may have about the GeoPose Standard.

The GeoPose Reviewers Guide contains hyperlinks which can be used to navigate directly to relevant sections of the guide.
