== Proprietary Software that Use or Generate GeoPose

In this section of the reviewer's guide, we list the proprietary solutions that use or generate a GeoPose.

We compile, in a structured format, the features and functions of each solution we identify.

Since new proprietary software offerings are being introduced to address the requirements of use cases covered by GeoPose, this section will be maintained/updated to the best of the ability of the SWG.

If you have information to contribute to this section, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in this repo.
