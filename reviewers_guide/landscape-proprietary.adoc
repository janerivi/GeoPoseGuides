== Proprietary Software that Use or Generate GeoPose

This section of the reviewer's guide captures approaches and any relevant information we have about commercial software that uses or generates pose of a digital object [or maybe also physical objects?] or a device (the device is the surrogate for the user in AR).

We compile, in a structured format, the features and functions of each solution we identify.

Since new proprietary software offerings are being introduced to address the requirements of use cases covered by GeoPose, this section will be maintained/updated to the best of the ability of the SWG.

If you have information to contribute to this section, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in this repo.

|Geospatial Pose
|Static WGS84 ellipsoid latitude, longitude, altitude
|latitude, longitude, altitude + an orientation (quaternion, or yaw, pitch, roll)
|The orientation of the camera or of geo-anchored objects are specified relative to a plane tangent to Earth at the geospatial position.
i.e. yaw is relative to North around 'up' axis, pitch is relative to the horizon around the sideways axis and roll is relative to 'up' around the forward axis.
