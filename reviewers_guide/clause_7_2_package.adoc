=== Logical Model
The conceptual model describes a (non-normative) domain of discourse for terms used in defining a precise Logical Model (normative) expressed as a Unified Modelling Language (UML) [ref] class diagram.

The scope of the Logical Model is a subset of the scope of the Conceptual Model. The scope of the implementation targets is a subset of the scope of the Logical Model.

The Implementation Targets are mutually independent implementations of subsets of the Logical Model.

In the standard, the Implementation Targets are expressed in Extended Backus-Naur Form where all terminal symbols reference attributes of classes in the Logical Model.
