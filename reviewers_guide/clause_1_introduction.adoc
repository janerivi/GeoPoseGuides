# Introduction

## What is GeoPose?
When a real or digital object’s pose is defined relative to a geographical frame of reference it will be called a geographically-anchored pose. All physical world objects inherently have a geographically-anchored pose. Digital objects may be assigned/attributed a geographically-anchored pose (for example, in a scene or on a stage). 

Shortest version:
OGC GeoPose defines encodings for theposition and orientation of a real or a digital objectin a machine-readable form in real world coordinates, a geographically-anchored pose.

The Standard
The GeoPose standard defines data structures for the interoperable exchange of the location and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (Poses) within reference frames anchored to the earth's surface (Geo). The standard specifies:

. a basic form with no configuration options for common use cases,
. an advanced form with more flexibility for more complex applications and
. composite GeoPose structures to support time series chain and graph structures.


## Target audience
The GeoPose Reviewers Guide is a resource for those who seek to understand the key concepts used in GeoPose.
