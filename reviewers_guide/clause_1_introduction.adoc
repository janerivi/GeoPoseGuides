## What is GeoPose?
NOTE: this is a placeholder until we have an agreed upon, final set of statements.

GeoPose 1.0 is an OGC Implementation Standard for exchanging the location and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (poses) within reference frames anchored to the earthâ€™s surface (Geo) or within other astronomical coordinate systems.

## Target audience
The GeoPose Reviewers Guide is a resource for //should we say what type of?// professionals who seek to understand the key concepts used in GeoPose and the landscape of options which currently exist as alternatives or adjacent to the GeoPose standard.
