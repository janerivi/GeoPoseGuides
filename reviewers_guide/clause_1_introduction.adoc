# Introduction

## What is GeoPose?
There are two answers to this question: a conceptual answer and an answer that explains what the standard provides.
Conceptual Answer: When a real or digital objectâ€™s pose is defined relative to a geographical frame of reference it will be called a [make sure that there's 100% alignment between this text and the glossary. Link to the glossary definition?]"geographically-anchored pose." All physical world objects inherently have a geographically-anchored pose. Digital objects may be associated with a geographically-anchored pose (for example, in a real-world overlay or on a stage).

What the Standard Provides: The OGC GeoPose standard defines a conceptual model, a logical model and encodings for theposition and orientation of a real or a digital objectin a machine-readable form in real world coordinates, a geographically-anchored pose.

## Why is Another Standard Needed?
A new standard is required to facilitate the seamless interchange of position and orientation information between proprietary systems and any systems that implement to existing standards. The <<rg-landscape-standard-section, **review of standards related to GeoPose**>> demonstrates that there are many relevant specifications that could use GeoPose, however, do not provide the elements.

## How Does OGC GeoPose Address Diverse Requirements?
The draft https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPose/blob/main/standard/pdf/geopose_standard.pdf[**OGC GeoPose 1.0 standard**] defines data structures for the interoperable exchange of the position and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (Poses) within reference frames anchored to the earth's surface (Geo).  In developing this standard, the SWG sought to use a single conceptual model to address requirements ranging from common use case that benefit from low complexity, and low optionality ("without optional parameters"), to those complex use cases needing high flexibility.

In order to meet the wide range of requirements, the OGC GeoPose specifies:

. Two basic forms with no configuration options for common use cases,
. An advanced form with more flexibility for more complex applications, and
. Five composite structures to support time series plus chain and graph structures.

GeoPose 1.0 is the derived link:http://www.ogc.org[OGC Implementation Standard] for exchanging GeoPoses.

## How Did we Define the GeoPose v 1.0 Scope?

While the earth is the focus of the GeoPose 1.0, the specification could also be used in conjunction with other astronomical bodies than the earth.

In the course of developing GeoPose v1.0 and in order to focus on the key objectives of the standard, it was decided to that the following considerations would be out of scope for the v1.0:

- details of any frame transformations (e.g., the radius of the Earth),
- differential properties (i.e., acceleration and velocity) and other physical properties of objects that could be associated with a GeoPose,
- concepts of uncertainty (accuracy and precision),
- camera models or view frustums,
- scaling and other non-rigid transforms,
- interpolation methods in case of complex targets, and
- [FILL IN ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN THINK OF]

NOTE: we could divide up and present this scope differently. We could also say that any of the above could be presented in parallel with GeoPose. Many of the aspects which were excluded could could be introduced in parallel as more properties in a schema.

## Who Will Use the OGC Reviewers Guide?
The GeoPose Reviewers Guide is a resource for those who seek to understand the key concepts used in OGC GeoPose, the requirements it meets and the data structures it specifies.

We intend this guide to be useful for reviewers of the standard as well as decision makers seeking to understand the relevance of this standard in their use cases.
