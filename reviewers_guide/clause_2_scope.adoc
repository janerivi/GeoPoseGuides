# Reviewers Guide Scope

The GeoPose Reviewers Guide introduces the reviewer to the <<vg-introduction-section, **key concepts used in GeoPose**>>. This guide can be used in conjunction with the OGC GeoPose https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPose/blob/main/standard/pdf/geopose_standard.pdf#use_case_summary[use cases] section of the standard. The SWG solicited use cases and chose five that have broadly applicable requirements.

The choices of https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPose/blob/main/standard/pdf/geopose_standard.pdf#standardization_targets[standardization targets] made in the GeoPose SWG during standard development are explained in <<rg-standardization-target-section, **this section**>> of the present guide.

Finally, this guide explains how GeoPose fits in the landscape of geospatial computing. It compares GeoPose with approaches that have been <<rg-landscape-standard-section, **taken in other standards**>>, and in <<rg-landscape-proprietary-section, **open source projects and libraries, and commercial products**>> for encoding geospatially-anchored position and orientation with six degrees of freedom.
