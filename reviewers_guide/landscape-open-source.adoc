== Open Source Libraries and Software that Use or Generate GeoPose

In this section of the reviewer's guide, we list the open source libraries and software solutions that use or generate a GeoPose.

We compile, in a structured format, the features and functions of each solution we identify.

Since there are new libraries and software being introduced from time to time, this section will be maintained/updated to the best of the ability of the SWG.

If you have information to contribute to this section, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in this repo.
