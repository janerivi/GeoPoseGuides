== Logical Model
While the Conceptual Model outlines the component terms and relationships in the standard, the Logical Model precisely models the classes and their relationships.

The Conceptual Model describes a (non-normative) domain of discourse for terms used in defining a precise Logical Model (normative) expressed as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) [ref] class diagram.

The scope of the Logical Model is a subset of the scope of the Conceptual Model. The scope of the implementation targets is a subset of the scope of the Logical Model.

The Implementation Targets are mutually independent implementations of subsets of the Logical Model.
