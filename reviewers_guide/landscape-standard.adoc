== Standards that Use or Generate GeoPose

In this section of the reviewer's guide, we list the Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and standards that use or generate a GeoPose.

The table to be used in this section has not yet been discussed and decided upon.

Within the table, we need links to the standards themselves. The link needs to be a human readable (in another column)

1. References (definitive reference) is a citation

Alos, must create a table dedicated to IEEE Standards. What are the IEEE standards?


Here are notes about two standards that have not yet been put into the table.

From BuildingSMARTS IFC4 BIM standard there is the concept of an "IFc Site". It lets users provide the WGS84 location (lat,lng,alt) of  "the single geographic reference point for this site "
http://standards.buildingsmart.org/MVD/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2_TC1/RV1_2/HTML/schema/ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcsite.htm
For orientation they refer to the concept of "true north": "The world coordinate system, established at the IfcProject.RepresentationContexts, may include a definition of the true north within the XY plane of the world coordinate system, if provided, it can be obtained at IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.TrueNorth."

|This extension allows an application to create a spatial anchor, an arbitrary freespace point in the user’s physical environment that will then be tracked by the runtime. The runtime should then adjust the position and orientation of that anchor’s origin over time as needed, independently of all other spaces and anchors, to ensure that it maintains its original mapping to the real world.

|An XRSpace represents a virtual coordinate system with an origin that corresponds to a physical location. Spatial data that is requested from the API or given to the API is always expressed in relation to a specific XRSpace at the time of a specific XRFrame. Numeric values such as pose positions are coordinates in that space relative to its origin. The interface is intentionally opaque.

There are also specifications (standards) that are developed for and used by industries/domains.

Space
The Observation Geometry System NASA uses for Space Science Missions is called SPICE.
A tutorial presentation about SPICE is available link:https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/Tutorials/pdf/individual_docs/03_spice_overview.pdf[here].
