== Standards that Use or Generate GeoPose

In this section of the reviewer's guide, we list the standards that use or generate a GeoPose.

From BuildingSMARTS IFC4 BIM standard there is the concept of an "IFc Site". It lets users provide the WGS84 location (lat,lng,alt) of  "the single geographic reference point for this site "

For orientation they refer to the concept of "true north": "The world coordinate system, established at the IfcProject.RepresentationContexts, may include a definition of the true north within the XY plane of the world coordinate system, if provided, it can be obtained at IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.TrueNorth."
