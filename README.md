# GeoPoseGuides

In this repo, members of the OGC GeoPose SWG are developing the GeoPose reviewers and users guides.

The documents will provide engineering guidance of different kinds to two audiences:
* Professionals who, for the purpose of providing detailed feedback and input to the SWG, seek to understand:
1. the key concepts underlying GeoPose and
2. the landscape of options which currently exist as alternatives or adjacent to the GeoPose standard.

* Users, which is an umbrella term to include people from highly diverse backgrounds, such as:
1. Implementers seeking to understand use of GeoPose and to include/integrate GeoPose in their diverse products and services,
2. Scientists and other R&D professionals who will use GeoPose for their projects,
3. Data miners that will use GeoPose to filter data sets,
4. Data publishers who will include GeoPose in their offerings, and
5. Others.

If you wish to contribute to the guides, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in this repo.
