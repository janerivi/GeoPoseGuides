# GeoPoseGuides

In this repo, members of the OGC GeoPose SWG are developing the GeoPose reviewers and users guides.

The documents provide engineering guidance of different kinds to two audiences:
* Professionals who, for the purpose of providing detailed feedback and input to the SWG, seek to understand:
**the key concepts underlying GeoPose and
**the landscape of options which currently exist as alternatives or adjacent to the GeoPose standard.

* Users, which is an umbrella term to include people from highly diverse backgrounds, such as:
** Implementers seeking to include/integrate GeoPose in their products and services,
** Scientists and other R&D professionals who will use GeoPose for their projects,
** Data miners that will use GeoPose to filter data sets,
** Data publishers who will include GeoPose in their offerings, and
** Others.

If you wish to contribute to the guides, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in this repo.
