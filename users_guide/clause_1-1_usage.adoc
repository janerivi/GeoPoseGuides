== How To Use This Resource

The GeoPose Users Guide is not intended to be read from start to finish. Rather, it is a resource structured to provide quick answers to questions which an implementer may have about the GeoPose standard.

The GeoPose User Guide includes hyperlinks which can be used to navigate directly to relevant sections of the Users Guide.

NOTE: This is a rough draft. A more refined writeup will be available at a later date.
