== How To Use This Resource

The Users Guide to the GeoPOS Conceptual Model Standard is not intended to be read from start to finnish. Rather, it is a resource structured to provide quick answers to questions which an implementer may have about the GeoPOS Standard. 

The GeoPOS Standard includes hyperlinks which can be used to navigate directly to relevant sections of the Users Guide.

NOTE: This is a rough draft. A more refined writeup will be avaliable at a latter date.
